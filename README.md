Advent of Code 2021
===================

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), in Haskell.
I'm totally new to Haskell so let's see how this goes...

Input for each day goes in `input/<day>`.

Each day can be run with `./run <day>`.
This will output the solutions for part 1 and part 2.

Unit tests can be run with `stack test`.
